In a distant future, as the Earth's environment deteriorates and becomes a deserted planet, humans have fled the
Earth.Once-bustling cities are now deserted,with only the remnants of robots and artificial intelligence left behind.
A young software engineer and craftsman named Alex discovers a mysterious energy crystal with unlimited power that
can rebuild The destroyed world, making The earth Great Again!
However, the crystal is buried deep in a dangerous minefield, becoming an obstacle to saving the world.
In addition, the detection found the presence of mutated gophers in the area.   Mutated Gophers attack outsiders and
can move mines, making mine clearance more difficult.
Alex programmed a special machine called the Thunderkeeper to both detect and pull out mines and attack mutated gophers
in an emergency operation named MTGA.
Now we have wrote a game sandtable for the "MTGA" operation and recruit players across the Federation to experiment.
In this game, players take on the role of Thunderkeeper and race against time to find energy crystals in the ruins
of underground cities.
However, mines are scattered throughout the area, and mutations are hampering the actions of participating players.
The game combines whack-a-mole and minesweeper mechanics to test the player's reflexes while also allowing the player
to have fun with calculations.
Participants with high scores in the MTGA sandbox will be the drivers of the Thunder Guardians, who will travel to the
abandoned planet Earth,
use wisdom and skill to remove mines, defeat enemies, and find these precious energy crystals to rebuild a new world.
The game sand table you are playing is closely related to the future fate of the earth, young man, struggle!
