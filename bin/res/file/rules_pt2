Game rules: The game interface is a 10*10 grid, similar to the initial interface of Minesweeper.
There are initially 10 mines placed on the grid. The gophers can be found on any grid and if they are not hit with
a hammer in time, the player will lose health. If the player's health reaches zero, the game will fail.

If a gopher is not hit, the player loses health and the hidden mines around the gopher (within a 3*3 range excluding
the 8 cells where the gopher is located) will be redistributed.

When a gopher is successfully hit, it falls down and triggers specific functions based on its species:

- Detection Gopher: When hit, exposes its grid and reveals numbers in surrounding grids (within a 3*3 range excluding
  those containing other gophers), indicating how many mines are nearby (similar to Minesweeper).

- Chaotic Gopher: When hit, does not expose its grid but redistributes mines within surrounding grids (within a 3*3
  range excluding those containing other gophers). No new mines appear in previously exploded grids.

- Unstable Gopher: When hit, exposes its grid. If there are mines in that particular grid, they explode causing the
  player to lose 5 health.

Scoring rules:
In the event of a game failure, the score increases proportionally with the number of mines discovered.
Conversely, in case of a game victory, the score is inversely proportional to the time taken.
